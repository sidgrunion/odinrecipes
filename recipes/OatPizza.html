        <h2>Homemade Oat Flour Pizza Crust</h2>
        <p>Friends, let me introduce you to my new favorite thing: Homemade Oat Flour 
            Pizza Crust.</p>
        <p>This healthy, super easy, hand-held oat flour pizza crust is made with just two 
            main ingredients and is versatile enough to go with both traditional 
            tomato-mozzarella toppings and less-traditional pizza situations such as a 
            bbq chicken pizza or Hawaiian pizza. Dairy and gluten free friendly too!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>Rolled oats. This recipe uses 1 cup of old-fashioned rolled oats. I 
                don't recommend using any other oat variety to make the crust</li>
                <li>Egg whites. 1/2 cup of liquid egg whites will bind the pulsed oats together 
                    to create a crust.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Start this oat flour pizza crust recipe by preheating the oven and heating a large 
                skillet on the stove. Add all crust ingredients to a food processor.</li>
            <li> Next, blend the crust ingredients until the mixture is fairly smooth and 
                looks like the picture below. Now, you simply take that oat/egg white 
                mixture, pour it onto a heated skillet and let it do its thang.</li>
            <li> I recommend shaping the crust with the back of a spoon into a circle and 
                spread for desired thickness. Let the pizza crust cook for about 5 minutes 
                and until edges start to brown and the crust is pretty set. The crust 
                should be lifting some when it is ready to flip. Use a spatula to flip the 
                crust over in the pan and cook the other side for about 2-3 minutes.</li>
            <li>The end. This is your crust. You just worked a miracle. Haha.. transfer it 
                to a baking sheet and top it with sauce and all of your favorite 
                toppings. Bake 10 minutes until cheese is melted and edges of the crust 
                are slightly browned. Serve up and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
